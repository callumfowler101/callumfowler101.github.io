            <p>
                Orbs is a midi visualiser built in openFrameworks. I wanted to build a visualiser 
                for live performance. Orbs uses midi data to create generative visuals on screen 
                and works with both single channel and multi channel midi devices.

                Watch the performance video below for a demonstration of Orbs working alongside Orca 
                (a live coding framework), and Ableton.

            <h2> My Ecology </h2>
            <p>
                My Ecology is an artwork which places the subject (a person) as the host for an invasive parasite 
                (the pixelated mould). At that point the subject and the digital parasite enter an 'ecological' 
                relationship. The result can be explicitly seen by the subject as the mould is grown over their image. 
                The project asks users to consider what their environmental impact is on the earth and how can they limit 
                the amount of 'mould' they generate in the real world.
                <br><br>
                The amount of mould grown over the subject is based on the amount of carbon dioxide their 
                home nation produces. Before running the software the user can determine which country 
                they want to use. The data has been gathered from the European Commission's 2018 report 
                on nation's carbon dioxide emissions. The software only focuses on the total amount of 
                co2 released.
                <br><br>
                The end result was a print which was displayed
                at Goldsmiths during the <em>Push, Pop, Repeat</em> exhibition.

            <h2> The Happy Computer </h2>
            <p>
                The happy computer is an interactive installation which places the computer 
                as a friendly entity that people can communicate with. The entity is called 'Happie', 
                and it has the ability to have a full conversation with the attendee. Human-computer 
                interaction (HCI) is the main focus of this project as the piece explores the relationship 
                between the two parties. 
                <br><br>
                I was interested in developing a system which did not rely on voice, but instead uses 
                gestures to communicate. The user is limited to selecting one of two choices giving the computer 
                the agency to lead the conversation, reversing the usual roles that humans and computers occupy.

                This performance explores the co-performance relationship between humans and computers. 
                It has been designed for an electric guitarist, however any instrument that can be 
                picked up by a microphone or connected to a line input can be used in this performance. 
                The piece encourages the Human to choose an instrument they can express 
                themselves with which the Computer will respond to in order to create the composition. 
                <br><br>
                The system is built on delay lines, used to control the voice of the computer
                as well as creating the sound texture and composition. Delay lines make
                the performers consider repetition and rhythm as a key part of the composition.
                Ideas of call-response and improvisation also create an ever evolving sound scape
                which only ends when the performers decide to.
                <br><br>
                This piece has been performed at Goldsmiths' <em>Can everyone see my screen?</em> online 
                exhibition.

            <p>
                Flow is a piece of installation art exploring ideas of complex movement and particle systems. It 
                was designed to mimic movements found in whirlpools, and create a calm and relaxing experience 
                for the viewer. The piece makes use of projection mapping, bringing it into the physical world. 
                This makes the experience more immersive and impactful as people can view the piece from many 
                different angles.
                <br><br>
                A custom physics engine was written for the artwork including the use of flow fields. When 
                prototyping flow I was interested in how different intialisation parameters affect the 
                underlying flow fields. I decided to give the four pools their own behaviours and 
                particle types. I also created three distinct scenes, which made it more engaging for the 
                viewers to watch over its three minute run time.
