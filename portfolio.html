            <h2> Orbs </h2>
            <p>
                Orbs is a midi visualiser which can be used with any midi device. Originally it
                was built to be used alongside the live coding environment, Orca. However now it
                can be used with any single channel or multi-channel device. It is currently in beta
                however hoping for a full release in late 2020.

            <h2> My Ecology </h2>
            <p>
                My ecology was a project created to present the amount of CO2 different
                countries produce. I created a digital mold, and using data 
                from the European Commission, digital mold was grown on the user. The end result was a print which was displayed
                at Goldsmiths during the <em>Push, Pop, Repeat</em> exhibition.

            <p>
                The happy computer is an interactive installation. "Happie" is a computer
                that just wants to be a friendly interface for humans to interact with. The system
                is able to have a conversation with the user and can also tell them a joke or some advice
                if they wish.

            <h2> Human and Computer </h2>
            <p>
                Human and Computer is a performance for two performers. The Human plays an improvised piece of music
                on an electric guitar, and the Computer uses MaxMSP to respond and generate new music. 
                This piece explores ideas of human-computer interaction and computer musical improvisation.
