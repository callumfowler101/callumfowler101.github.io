        <p style="grid-area: e1">
            At the center of the audio engine is a phase modulation algorithm.
            This method was chosen as it allows for a variety of timbres to be
            created with only a few parameter changes. Having such an adaptable 
            system meant that aesthetically pleasing presets could be easily made. 
            While natural sounds can be made using phase modulation, the digital 
            timbres created support the aesthetic of <em>Constellations</em>. With the 
            user given the ability to mutate timbres, they have a vast amount of sounds
            in their palms.

            At first glance the star maps created 
            could mistakenly be seen as just a novel interface

            maps generated tell a story of the exploration
            undertaken by the user. It becomes a graphical score and, like
            any musical score, can be read to understand the music on a
            deeper level.

            The name, sounds, and visuals of <em>Constellations</em> are all designed
            to inspire exploration and play. The star maps the user creates are there to
            support all of this. These constellations gives the user
            an immediate response to their actions. They are also a visual history of the
            current session as each one evolves as the user adapts the sequences. The abilty 
            to change position and control the colour of the different layers also adds personalisation
            to that specific composition. All the visuals are there to create a sense of engagement and 
            ownership with the user, encouraging them to work through their session to create a compelling
            composition.

        <p style="grid-area: e1">
            This work was heavily inspired by <a href="https://www.hz-journal.org/n9/herber.html">Norbert Herber's idea of "The Composition Instrument"</a>.
            In his article Herbert sets out his criteria for what a composition instrument is. He explains how this type
            of instrument should be a balance between composition and improvisation, strategy and chance. The instrument can also
            be played or performed and can be used in a multitude of situations. Exploration also seems to be a common theme
            in the examples Herbert presents. The systems all seem to encourage play and interaction through discovery. Because of this 
            discovery and play became key parts in <em>Constellations</em> design ethos.  
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e2">
            Another field of research that heavily inspired this piece was genetic algorithms,
            specifically their use in navigating parameter spaces on digital instruments.

        <h2 style="grid-area: title">Previous Concepts</h2>
        <p style="grid-area: e1">
            Before <em>Constellations</em> was realised this project began
            life as an experiment to explore sound in novel ways.
            The original concept used genetic algorithms to change
            the sound engine parameters. The user just had to select
            which sounds they liked and new, similar sounds would be
            created. 
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e2">
            From a computational point of view, this was a very
            interesting way to navigate parameter spaces. Unfortunately 
            it did not feel very responsive or engaging for the user.
            Non-specialists may also feel detached from the instrument
            as they are not aware of the underlying algorithms. For these
            reasons the earlier concepts were dropped.
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e3">
            Not everything was lost from the original concept as a number
            of ideas were bought over. The technique of using genetic sequences
            to generate audio parameters was a key concept that was implemented in the
            final version of <em>Constellations</em>. Also other design elements such as mutating
            and making it a sequencer were carried over. Despite <em>Constellations</em>
            looking very different from its ancestors, it needed that evolution to grow
            into what it is today.

        <h2 style="grid-area: title">Hardware</h2>
        <p style="grid-area: e1;">
            A raspberry pi 3A+ is the brains of the operation. All of the computing comes
            from this device, which means <em>Constellations</em> is a completely portable
            instrument. This was a key design choice as the user is now unshackled from 
            their computer. It also means <em>Constellations</em> can be integrated into any
            DAW and DAW-less setup. 
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e2">
            The touch screen is a Pimoroni Hyperpixel. It is a capacitive 60Hz display and is 
            ideal for the synthesiser. As the user will be interacting with the instrument for 
            a long time, it is important that the screen is has a pleasant viewing experience. 
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e3">
            The rest of the controls given to the user are all being routed through an IO expander.
            While the Hyperpixel is a brilliant display it does take up all of the Pi's GPIO pins.
            For this reason I had to use an IO expander so I could run everything on the Pi.

        <h2 style="grid-area: title">Software</h2>
        <p style="grid-area: e1">
            A number of languages and frameworks have been used to create the software 
            of Constellations. The heart of the project is an openFrameworks (C++) application. 
            openFrameworks generates all of the graphics displayed to the user, and handles to OSC routing 
            so the controls and audio engine work with the main app. 
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e2">
            The audio engine has been built using PureData, a node based scripting language.
            The engine is built using phase modulation techniques. This technique enables the 
            synth to create a multitude of different timbres.   
        </p>
        <p style="grid-area: e3">
            Python has been used to programme the hardware controls. All data is being sent using
            OSC which is ideal for cross language/app data transfers.
