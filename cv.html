        <h2>Portfolio</h2>
        <p>Please see my <a href="https://callumfowler101.github.io/portfolio.html">website</a> or my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/motivated_sloth/">instagram</a> for visual portfolios.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <li>
            Musical Composition/Production: I regularly write and produce music. 
            I am always working on personal music projects. This has recently moved 
            to live coding in Orca and Ableton.
        </li>
        <li>
            Human Interface and Interaction: Many of my projects examine how humans 
            interface with technology. I am also very interested in how humans interact 
            with other non-technological artefacts through their design.
        </li>
        <li>
            Personal Projects: I enjoy coming up with projects and challenges 
            to advance my skills; such as building a personal website to showcase work.
        </li>
        <h2>Detailed Professional Experience</h2>
        <h3>Hanky Panky Pancakes (June 2013-2020)</h3>
        <li>
            Since 2013 my family have owned a restaurant in Chester, 
            which has given me a number of experiences while helping the 
            restaurant develop and grow.
        </li>
        <li>
            Restaurant Supervisor: I predominantly worked front-of-house interacting with
            members of the public and run shifts
        </li>
        <li>
            Web Consultant: During lockdown, we had to shift our business to a delivery
            service. I helped develop our website to be a landing page for customers to order from.
        </li>
        <h3>Audio Engineer (Summer 2016)</h3>
        <li>
            During my time in Leeds, I was able to shadow a sound engineer
            at a well known music venue. This opportunity has been incredibly 
            useful when setting up my own AV installations and performances.
        </li>
        <li>I worked with touring artists to set up the stage to their specification</li>
        <li>
            I learnt how to setup a safe and professional environment for the audience to
            experience the performance
        </li>
